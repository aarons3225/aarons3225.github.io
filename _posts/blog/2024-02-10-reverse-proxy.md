I spent this weekend trying to figure out reverse proxy. I tried NGINX, Caddy, and finally Traefik. I couldnâ€™t get nginx or caddy to work even after multiple attempts. I finally got traefik to work after all day messing with it. Now I have some services exposed via a traefik and authelia combo.

Maybe on a later date, I explain how I got it to work.
