I bought my R730 and was super excited. I got a couple accessories to go with it like a NVIDIA Quadro P4000, a keyboard, mouse, and monitor. I quickly found that the server would not fit in my Network rack, to my disappointment. I ended up just laying it on top. I installed TrueNAS and some drives.

I started to copy the files from one NAS to this one. Once done, I felt like it was more robust. There were no lagging issues like I had on the Qnap.

I had a few things I had to figure out. Due to the graphics card not being from Dell, it caused the fans to spin up and be incredibly loud in my home office. I found a solution via an application on TrueCharts, a TrueNAS application repository. It allowed controlling the fan speed which also reduced the volume.

Once summer hit, I ran into another problem. My office was now 10 degrees warmer at least, than the rest of my house. I ended up having to shut it down for the summer.
