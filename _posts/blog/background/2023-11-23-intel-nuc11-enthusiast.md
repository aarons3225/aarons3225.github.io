So for my experience as of 11/23/23, using windows so far didn’t seem that bad at first. I could remote into it using Microsoft’s Remote Manager. Having a GUI seemed nice and it was not bad looking. Installing Plex seemed like a breeze. So was installing handbrake and makemkv. I mounted the media files remotely using my NAS and got Plex set up.

Where this goes badly, is that for some reason the system continues to fall asleep and interferes with Plex staying open to serve my media. I looked through all the settings and changed all the ones I could find. I looked online for help. I changed a few more settings. It still won’t keep it open.

I am debating on whether to install Ubuntu Server on it. I can use Windows to update my handheld ham radio as the software only runs on Windows. On the other hand, Linux has given me no issues. I am currently debating in my head.
