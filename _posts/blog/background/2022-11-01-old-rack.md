# Echogear
The Netgear Orbi was decent, but there was some spottiness. I started following some Reddit groups and went down some rabbit holes on YouTube. I found the [Unifi Dream Machine](https://ui.com/us/cloud-gateways/dream-machine). I spent quite a bit of time deliberating and saving. I finally bought it along with some accessories. I spent a day wiring my house with Cat6 ethernet cabling, installing the Access Points, and setting it up with my ISP. I also had to get a rack for it.

I set it all up and it worked gloriously. I found it also gave me room to grow as my knowledge and experience grew.

I learned a little about vlans, and set some up. My goal was to have certain things on their own vlan depending on the category it falls under. I followed some guides online and they worked well except when I added firewalls and rules for them.

I ended up deleting the rules for them as it did not work as well as I thought it might.

I also ended up switching VPN providers as I was using TorVPN and I went to NordVPN. I did this because I could not get TorVPN to be added to my router as a client. I did get NordVPN to work. I also found a limitation with the Dream Machine. I could not specify certain traffic to be routed through the VPN. It had to be done via IP address. If it is possible, I havenâ€™t figured it out yet.
