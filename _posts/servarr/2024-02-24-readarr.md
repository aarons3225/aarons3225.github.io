# Readarr
Readarr is an eBook and audiobook collection manager for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new books and will interface with clients and indexers to grab, sort, and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of existing files in the library when a better quality format becomes available. It does not manage comics or magazines.

# Docker Compose

SSH into your server. Depending on how you want to set it up you can create a folder called docker and nest your docker compose folders inside like /docker/readarr or just create a folder called readarr. Then cd into it.

For /docker/readarr do this...
``` sh
sudo mkdir docker && cd docker
```
then
``` sh
sudo mkdir readarr && cd readarr
```
or for just a readarr directory like /readarr do this...
``` sh
sudo mkdir readarr && cd readarr
```

Once you create the desired folders, create a docker compose file. Assuming you have V2 of docker compose, you don't need a hyphen between or docker in front.

``` sh
sudo touch compose.yml
sudo nano compose.yml
```
Then just copy this into your text editor:

``` yaml
services: 
	readarr: 
		container_name: readarr 
		image: ghcr.io/hotio/readarr
		ports:
			- "8787:8787" 
		environment: 
			- PUID=1000 
			- PGID=1000 
			- UMASK=002 
			- TZ=Etc/UTC 
		volumes: 
			- /<host_folder_config>:/config 
			- /<host_folder_data>:/data
```

Make sure to change the TZ to your Time Zone. For example, mine would look like TZ=America/Phoenix. Do the same to your PUID and GUID.

Also modify your config folder. Only modify the left side of the colon. For example mine on a linux server would look like:
``` yaml
 volumes:
  - /home/aaron/docker/readarr:/config
```
The data folder is for the application to access your media files so it can monitor your media library. Make sure this folder is set up to access your media however you have it set up. If you are using a USB external hard drive, it should be found under /media. If you are using a NAS with mounted folders, it is usually found under /mnt/<whatever you named the folder>. 

Once you have the desired settings, copy the entire file and paste into your compose.yml file.

Now you can run it with:
``` sh
sudo docker compose up -d
```

# Accessing readarr

Now that you have it running, open your favorite web browser and go to http://localhost:8787 if running on the same machine, or if it is not, use the ip address of the server. 

You now have a running version of readarr!!
