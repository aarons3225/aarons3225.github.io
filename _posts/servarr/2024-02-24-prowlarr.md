# Prowlarr

Prowlarr is an indexer manager/proxy built on the popular arr .net/reactjs base stack to integrate with your various PVR apps. Prowlarr supports management of both Torrent Trackers and Usenet Indexers. It integrates seamlessly with [LazyLibrarian](https://lazylibrarian.gitlab.io/), [Lidarr](https://wiki.servarr.com/lidarr), [Mylar3](https://github.com/mylar3/mylar3), [Radarr](https://wiki.servarr.com/radarr), [Readarr](https://wiki.servarr.com/readarr), and [Sonarr](https://wiki.servarr.com/sonarr) offering complete management of your indexers with no per app Indexer setup required (we do it all).

# Docker Compose

SSH into your server. Depending on how you want to set it up you can create a folder called docker and nest your docker compose folders inside like /docker/prowlarr or just create a folder called prowlarr. Then cd into it.

For /docker/prowlarr do this...
``` sh
sudo mkdir docker && cd docker
```
then
``` sh
sudo mkdir prowlarr && cd prowlarr
```
or for just a prowlarr directory like /prowlarr do this...
``` sh
sudo mkdir prowlarr && cd prowlarr
```

Once you create the desired folders, create a docker compose file. Assuming you have V2 of docker compose, you don't need a hyphen between or docker in front.

``` sh
sudo touch compose.yml
sudo nano compose.yml
```
Then just copy this into your text editor:

``` yaml
services: 
  prowlarr: 
    container_name: prowlarr 
    image: ghcr.io/hotio/prowlarr:latest 
    ports: - "9696:9696" 
    environment: 
      - PUID=1000 
      - PGID=1000 
      - UMASK=002 
      - TZ=Etc/UTC 
    volumes: 
      - /<host_folder_config>:/config
```
Make sure to change the TZ to your Time Zone. For example, mine would look like TZ=America/Phoenix. Do the same to your PUID and GUID.

Also modify your config folder. Only modify the left side of the colon. For example mine on a linux server would look like:
``` yaml
 volumes:
  - /home/aaron/docker/prowlarr:/config
```
Once you have the desired settings, copy the entire file and paste into your compose.yml file.

Now you can run it with:
``` sh
sudo docker compose up -d
```

# Accessing Prowlarr

Now that you have it running, open your favorite web browser and go to http://localhost:9696 if running on the same machine, or if it is not, use the ip address of the server. 

You now have a running version of prowlarr!!
